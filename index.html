<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h1>

<p>I am examining the average arrival delays by select major airlines in select major US destination cities between the years 2000-2008 by day of week.  I want to examine which days of the week experienced the most and least arrival delays.  </p>

<p>What I found was 2000 seemed to be the worse for arrival delays with several airlines having delays on average over 10 minutes, United being the worse with over 20 minute delays.  </p>

<p>From 2000 - 2003, you see a steady improvement in arrival delays, with even the worse offenders - Continental and Delta Airlines - coming in under 6 minutes on average.  Unfortunately, 2004 - 2008 saw a continual increase for all airlines except Southwest Airlines, with several airlines averaging between 10 - 18 minutes. </p>

<p>From a day per week standpoint, all airlines seemed to have their lowest delay times on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and their highest delay times on Thursdays and Fridays.  Which makes sense based on the typical busy travel days matching this finding.</p>

<p>I have taken the Flight data from <a href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html/">http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html/</a> and its supplemental data (carriers.csv/airports.csv) and combined data from the 3 sources.  I then filtered down to a small subset of carriers and destination cities as listed below it.  The reason for filtering the data was due to the large dataset (over 2GB even filtered).  From performance posts I found researching dimplejs and d3js, I've seen posts saying 11MB as being excessive. Instead I pre-processed the data using the append_csv.py script and calculated the average daily arrival delay by carrier, airport, day of week and year.  I was originally working with a csv file, but in researching performance issues, found the suggestion of using a json input file to limit the parsing phase required from converting csv to a json object:</p>

<a id="data-visualization" class="anchor" href="#data-visualization" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Visualization</h2>

<p>I have developed this visualization using primarily dimple.js with some d3.js tweaks based on example visualizations from <a href="http://www.dimplejs.org">http://www.dimplejs.org</a>, in particular the bubble chart and interactive legend examples. </p>

<p>I created a dimple story board which is animated by year from 2000 - 2008.  The animation can be paused by selecting the year you want to pause on.  You can restart animation by selecting the year a second time.</p>

<p>I also used an interactive legend by airline carrier for filtering the data points displayed, and I also created a 'chart' to handle filtering of the aggregated data by major city airports.</p>

<li>As per reviewer suggestion, I added a secondary bar chart series based on Average Flights Per Day to make this more of an 'Explanatory' Visualization. </li>
<li>I changed the xaxis to categorize by Day of Week and Unique Carrier Name, ensuring sort order was correct</li>

<li>Repositioned airport selector under carrier filter to keep it from getting hidden</li>
<li>Changed references to 'cities' to 'airports'</li>
<li>Moved descriptive text to below the chart, and made it part of the javascript instead of html body so it displays at same time as chart</li>
<li>Increased font/shape size of year selectors</li>

Awesome Job!. Javascript is well implemented, good use of semicolons and indentation.
</p>

<p>
However there are some issues with the HTML and how javascript libraries are call. Following I review the different issues:
</p>

<p>
Javascript libraries import: Instead of working with d3 local files, you can simple call d3 library from their website (see line below). Please have a look at this link for further information.</p>

<p>
DOCTYPE: this line must be included in order to allow browser to properly render the file, more info here</p>

<p>
Encoding: for the browser to load the required chart set, you need to include the line below, see more info here:</p>

<p>
html content: it must be included in the body, please have a look at this link for a reference of a html template.</p>

This is a great visualization, you were able to include a lot of information and still make it look great. By selecting airlines, airports and years, viewers can really do a deep exploration of the data. Your d3 code is coded well, and you got some great feedback, well done!.

When I look at the chart, I understand how average delay times behave along the week. But that's really an exploratory visualization rather than explanatory. What I can't tell from this plot is what drives the average delay times along the week. In your summary I can read: "From a day per week standpoint, all airlines seemed to have their lowest delay times on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and their highest delay times on Thursdays and Fridays. Which makes sense based on the typical busy travel days matching this finding.", so it seems delays are related with average flights per day. This is actually the key I miss in your visualization. By adding this piece of information your visualization now becomes explanatory, users can now understand why delay times behave in such way.

STEPS TO PASS THIS SECTION:

Incorporate the average flight number per day in your chart.

Hi @cheryl_592988902, thanks for posting your latest version. I've taken a look and so I'll post a few thoughts on here to encourage more discussion! I hope you don't mind that I've not posted on GitHub.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some things I like</p>

<ul>
<li>the use of coloured lines to represent airlines and connecting the dots so you can see a 'profile of a typical week'</li>
<li>the interesting pattern over the week -- I had no idea that there was a consistent pattern of delays!</li>
<li>the user instructions, so I know what to do to interact with the plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some things I like less</p>

<ul>
<li>The way that the y-axis moves between years. This is really distracting for me, I can't make any comparison between years.</li>
<li>In a few places, the tooltips and axis labels names are unpolished: "AvgArrDelay" and "DayOfWeek" look like variable names rather than user-facing labels.</li>
<li>The fact that the animation starts and continues by default unless I stop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more ideas</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd be interested in seeing the pattern in arrival delays over the whole period -- I don't feel this is currently conveyed by the animation. Perhaps another plot (average delay over the years for each airline?) or small multiples would convey this information?</li>
<li>I think there might be too many variables involved. Day of the week, year, airline, airport combinations, delay times are all encoded here. I'm not particularly likely to stumble across a particularly interesting airport or airline without a bit of guidance of what to look for. Is your main aim to show patterns of delays through the years or through the week? Is there anything specific you're hoping to show about a certain airline or airport?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi @cheryl_592988902, I agree with the comments from <a href="https://github.com/Charlie" class="user-mention">@Charlie</a>. In addition
</p>

<p>
Nice chart!!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>** Like **</p>

<ul>
<li>Interactive choices</li>
<li>Open circle points - they act like hinges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like Less</p>

<ul>
<li>The vertical axis movement from negative values - I guess that is arriving ahead of schedule. I think it would be ok treat this as zero because it is infrequent and your chart is one of "delays" and it begs an explanation
strongly agree scale of the y axis -should not change - then the story of increasing delays from year to year will be more apparent</li>
<li>The x axis ticks are distracting because they break the vertical alignment of the day of week label an the aligned points.
your airport selector gets hidden with a more narrow browser width. Perhaps place it under the carrier filter</li>
<li>The title says "cities" but the data is for "airports"
try it without the horizontal grid .. I don't think the actual measurements are important. This may make the whole chart feel simpler and may make the animation feel more fluid</li>
<li>try it with fewer y axis markings (greater intervals) - perhaps five minutes will be a more natural/intuitive increment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Great!!!</p>

<p>
Hi @cheryl_592988902,
</p>

<p>
Nice chart, the design is very good as well as the different transitions
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What I like :</p>

<ul>
<li>The animation and transitions (including the one when removing an airline)</li>
<li>The message being shared</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I like less :</p>

<ul>
<li>I would probably put the explanation text below the graph instead</li>
<li>The y-axis constantly changing, it's difficult to compare between years</li>
<li>Negative y-values, you should put a minimum to 0</li>
<li>The selection for the years and airports are fairly small, hence it's not always clear where I am at a specific time. You would probably want to increase the difference of shade when selecting an airport</li>
<li>You may want to remove the circle tooltip while the animation is running as it goes away very quickly as the graph changes.</li>
<li>In the title I would say "selected" instead of "select"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Questions</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you notice in the visualization?</li>
<li><p>A smooth transition between years</p></li>
<li><p>What questions do you have about the data?</p></li>
<li><p>How it was collected and how outliers are being handled (cancelled flights etc..)</p></li>
<li><p>What relationships do you notice?</p></li>
<li>Saturday being the best performer in terms of arriving on time
Tuesday seems to go on and off across years</li>
<li><p>Southwest Airlines seems to have worked hard on their delays, going from a below average airline to a champion across the years</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?</p></li>
<li><p>There's a lot of focus on Saturday instead of other weekdays for performance of airlines</p></li>
<li><p>Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?</p></li>
<li>The negative values even though I understand that it is flights arriving before scheduled time but it's still odd</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I hope this helps !
</p>

<p>
Kind Regards,
</p>

<p>
Yohann

<p>new version is hopefully much clearer (changed the bubble chart to a line chart with line markers), hopefully this will make the day to day relationships more clear. Regarding the yellow dots remaining in same spot, if you notice, the scale changes from year to year, that may be why it appears they are remaining the same. As for the purpose of the year over year, it makes it possible to see improvement and/or degradation in arrival times over time.</p>

<p>as for the yellow/orange color being too close, I changed the yellow to a light purple, so hopefully its easier to distinguish the different lines.</p>

<p>Thanks Alan, good feedback! I have a new version I will be uploading later today or tomorrow (waiting for feedback from class peers). This new version fixes the disappearing data issue, and makes the airport filter clearer and easier to read. I also changed the bubble graph to a line graph with line markers so that the day to day differences are more obvious. I liked the bouncing balls, but it didn't make that relationship very clear.</p>

<p>I haven't figured out how to keep the animation paused when filtering by carrier or airport yet, still working to figure out how to do that.</p>

<li>I first noticed how much easier it was to detect trends when the years flow automatically across. Not having to take my eyes off the data or trend pattern to click on different years gave a better appreciation for gaps in info. To go back and single out a year is also simple to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What questions do you have about the data?</p>

<ul>
<li>How to keep raw data integrity in check - i.e.: one time meaning a plane pulls away from the gate, or actually takes off?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What relationships do you notice?</p>

<ul>
<li>It appears to mostly remain consistently inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think is the main take-away from this visualization?</p>

<ul>
<li>Very smart, easy to read way to interpret what would normally be a very cumbersome data set. Very good to market / prove on time capabilities to consumer, or investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?</p>

<ul>
<li>Per airport numbers were a little confusing, but that may be my system may not meet requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any Additions Comments:</p>

<li>Very exciting to check this out!</li>

<p>Thanks Joey! good feedback.</p>

<p>I have a new release coming later today or tomorrow that fixes the airport selector and a few other issues (like disappearing data). Hopefully that will make it clearer. While I liked the look of the bubble chart, I changed it to a line chart with line markers. It makes the day to day relationships much clearer.</p>

<p>Re: "How to keep raw data integrity in check - i.e.: one time meaning a plane pulls away from the gate, or actually takes off?"</p>

<p>I'm not clear on what you are asking? The raw data I based this on had multiple 'delay' timings and some (but limited) cause indicators. However, the data set itself, even filtering down to just these carriers and airports was till almost 2GB, and would never load in the browser using the tools I've been given. So I decided to just concentrate on the average arrival delay, thinking from a consumer standpoint, that is what most people would care about. I definitely see where the airlines or regulation industry would care much more on drilling down on specific causes. Is that what you were referring to?</p>

<p>Yes, that is what I was referring to, and it was more industry related, but given each airline had their own criteria for the definition of on time... Well, what can you do to control that?</p>

<p>I am really impressed with how you tamed THAT MUCH data in one file. Very nice!</p>

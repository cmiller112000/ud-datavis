I want to examine which days of the week experienced the most and least arrival delays.  I have taken the Flight data from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html/ and its supplemental data (carriers.csv/airports.csv) combined data from the 3 sources, then filtered down to a small subset\r\nof carriers as listed below, and cities below it.  The reason for filtering the data was due to the large dataset (over 2GB even filtered).  Instead I pre-processed the data and calculated the average daily arrival delay by carrier, airport, day of week and year:\r\n\r\nCode | Description\r\n---- | -----------\r\nAA | American Airlines Inc.\r\nCO | Continental Air Lines Inc.\r\nDL | Delta Air Lines Inc.\r\nUA | United Air Lines Inc.\r\nWN | Southwest Airlines Co.\r\n\r\nState | Cities\r\n----- | ------\r\n\"NY\" | [\"New York\"]\r\n\"IL\" | [\"Chicago\"]\r\n\"TX\" | [\"Dallas\",\"Dallas-FtWorth\",\"Houston\",\"Austin\"]\r\n\"CA\" | [\"Los Angeles\", \"San Francisco\"]\r\n\"GA\" | [\"Atlanta\"]\r\n\"FL\" | [\"Miami\", \"Orlando\"]\r\n\"MA\" | [\"Boston\"]\r\n\"VA\" | [\"Arlington\",\"Chantilly\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have added long/lat data as well as merged the airport and carrier name information into a single flightdelays.json file with the following fields:\r\n\r\nField Name | Field Description\r\n---------- | -----------------\r\nDest long | longitude of destination airport\r\nDest lat | lat of destination airport\r\nDest airport | airport name of destination\r\nArrDelay | Arrival Delay in minutes\r\nUniqueCarrierName | Air Carrier Name\r\nDayOfWeek | Mon, Tues, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun\r\nYear | 2000 - 2008\r\n\r\n# Design\r\nI have developed this visualization using primarily dimple.js with some d3.js tweaks based on example visualizations from http://www.dimplejs.org, in particular the bubble chart and interactive legend examples.  I am displaying the average arrival delay in minutes for the selected airline carriers and major city airports.  The story board is animated by year from 2000 - 2008 and the airline carriers and/or major city  airports are available as data filters.\r\n\r\n## Release 1 - Issues\r\n* How to remove \"year\": 1.0m type tooltip due to MeasureAxis on \"Year\"?\r\n* Filter by Airport - when reactivating, does not re-include filtered data.  Any ideas why?\r\n* Both Filter by Carrier Name and Filter by Airport - when activating and de-activating filters, both re-trigger a paused animation.  Any ideas how to stop this?\r\n \r\n# Average Arrival Delay Visualization\r\n\r\n[Run Data Visualization!](https://rawgit.com/cmiller112000/ud-datavis/master/index.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n## Questions for Reviewers:\r\n\r\n* What do you notice in the visualization?\r\n* What questions do you have about the data?\r\n* What relationships do you notice?\r\n* What do you think is the main take-away from this visualization?\r\n* Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?\r\n\r\nPlease answer by creating an issue on my github repository following the example issue under my name:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cmiller112000/ud-datavis/issues/\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n* http://www.d3js.org/\r\n* http://www.dimplejs.org/\r\n* http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html/\r\n* http://www.stackoverflow.com/\r\n* http://www.udacity.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
